# WUULF 2023 Theme Speaker

### Rev. Bob LaVallee

Rev. Bob LaVallee serves First Unitarian Church of Albuquerque as Associate Minister. Prior to that he served as Interim Minister at South Valley UU Society outside Salt Lake City, UT. Bob was born and raised in Buffalo, NY and returned there while in seminary at Meadville Lombard Theological School. In between rooting for the Bills and shoveling snow, Bob was on the core leadership committee for the Buffalo chapter of Showing Up for Racial Justice. Bob is a former Marine Corps Artillery Officer and trained as a chaplain at the Veterans Administration Hospital in New York City. Bob loves Ghost Ranch and is thrilled to be joining the WUULF community. 

Rev. Bob will be leading us in a series of “Creating Theology Together” workshops.

>How we work, who we love, when we eat, what we read, these all form us as spiritual people. Everyday I try to remember that as I practice being a Unitarian Universalist minister and leading a church. 
>
>And as I consider my (very crooked) path to the ministry, I realize that everything I did up to now was faith formation. Some of it was profoundly helpful. Some of it was an absolute waste of time. And some of it only revealed itself to be useful long after the experience. My past is prologue to my ministry, and it makes me a well-rounded minister.
>
>I made Unitarian Universalism my home. My hope is to help other folks find their way home in this tradition, so that they in turn can be a light in the darkness, helping to make a more just and caring world.
