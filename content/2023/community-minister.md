# WUULF 2023 Minister

### Rev. Addae Ama Kraba 

Reverend Addae Ama Kraba (she/her) was ordained in the Unitarian Universalist Denomination, after earning a Master of Divinity from Starr King School for the Ministry in Berkeley, California. Prior to attending seminary, she earned a Bachelor of Science in Organizational Behavior from the University of San Francisco. Rev. Addae began her ministry with a call to the [First Universalist Church of Southold](http://firstuniversalistsouthold.org/), New York. This established her as the first minister of color to settle in the congregation’s 150-year history.

She has served at all levels of the denomination, beginning with the [Unitarian Universalist Association’s Committee on Anti-Racism, Anti-Oppression, and Multiculturalism](https://www.uuma.org/page/comaraom) of the Unitarian Universalist Minister’s Association, trustee on the board of the Murray Grove Retreat and Conference Center in Lanoka Harbor, New Jersey, and the board of the Joseph Priestly District.  She currently serves the [Unitarian Universalists of New Braunfels](https://www.uunb.org/).

As adjunct faculty Rev. Addae taught classes on “Sacred Rest” and “Her Story: African Goddess’s” at Starr King School for the Ministry. She has published work in “She is Everywhere, Vol II an anthology of Writing in Womanist/Feminist Spirituality, Lifting Our Voices, Readings in The Living Tradition, Voices from The Margins an anthology of Meditations, and Conversations with the Sacred, a collection of prayers”. 

#### WUULF looks forward to welcoming Rev. Addae to our community this year!
