A lifelong UU, Sarah first attended Wuulf in 2017 after several years of turmoil:  the death of both her parents, the end of her marriage, and a cross country move.  She was in need of healing, compassion, and fun and found them at Wuulf!  When she's not at Wuulf, Sarah works at Columbine UU Church in Littleton, Colorado, and raises her two teenaged sons.

Dave like so many other WUULFies, was heard all the wonderful things about WUULF from friends who have been attending for many years. He attended the first 3 years as a Coywolf teacher (high school), and has been on the board for 4 years.

In his free time, Dave plays recreational ice hockey, dabbles in painting and drawing, and can often be found chillin at the dog park with his dog Lucas.
