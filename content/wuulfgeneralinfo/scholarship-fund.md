# WUULF Scholarship Fund

WUULF has limited funds available to provide need-based scholarships for registration fees; we do not offer assistance for room and board. Please remember that the campground is a good option for those who wish to minimize costs. Scholarships requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Deadline for 2023 scholarship applications is To Be Announced. Late scholarship applications will not be considered. If you would like to apply for a scholarship, please send the requested information (see below) to:

#### Requested  information:
- Name, Address, Phone, Number of adults, teens and children needing scholarships.
- Names of any other UU camps attended in the last 5 years.
- What UU church you attend and a brief synopsis of your involvement there.
- A brief paragraph describing why you want to attend WUULF.
- A brief paragraph about what you feel you could contribute to this camp, if awarded a scholarship, for example, a workshop you could give, an organizational talent, photography, etc.

Scholarship recipients will be asked to help out with various activities throughout the week.  Members of the WUULF Scholarship Committee will review all applications and recipients will be notified by May 1st.

Our scholarships are funded through tee shirt sales and our annual raffle. A big “thank you” to all those who continue to make donations and purchase raffle tickets and Tee-shirts, thereby making our scholarships possible!

#### SCHOLARSHIP RAFFLE
Details of this year’s raffle will be announced at camp. Most raffle items are donated by camp participants—please bring items you wish to donate to registration, and we will display them in the Lower Pavilion. Tickets are $2 each, or 3 for $5 and all profits go to the scholarship fund. Buy early and buy often! You can start by ordering some on your registration form. Don’t wait too late to buy—your favorite item might be raffled off early.

#### T-SHIRTS SALES ALSO BENEFIT THE SCHOLARSHIP FUND
We have a limited number of 100% organic cotton tee shirts in two colors (Kitchen Mesa yellow and Pedernal sky blue) on hand – reserve yours now! Available in adult and youth sizes. Specify the number of shirts you want on your registration form and pay in advance—then pick them up when you arrive at camp. These beautiful shirts are decorated with the unique WUULF spiral chalice design and are made of comfortable, medium-weight cotton. No need to specify size or color—you can choose your perfect shirt from our inventory at camp.
