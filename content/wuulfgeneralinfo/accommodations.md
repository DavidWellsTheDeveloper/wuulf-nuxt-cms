# Ghost Ranch Accommodations

#### Ghost Ranch

Ghost Ranch is a Presbyterian owned camp and conference center, located in Northern New Mexico west of Taos and Santa Fe. Once owned and operated by Arthur Pack (friend of Georgia O’Keeffe, the American artist), the ranch is framed by the majestic view of Chimney Rock, the Abiquiu Reservoir, and to the south a peak named Cerro Pedernal. Such splendid natural beauty has long been thought of as a spiritual place, and the perfect environment for us to create the intentional community of WUULF. With plenty of meeting rooms for workshops and 21,000 acres for hiking, an onsite library open 24 hours a day, a labyrinth which is available 24 hours a day for exploring, and afternoon swimming, Ghost Ranch has everything we need for our camp. There is a no smoking policy inside all buildings and pets are not allowed on campus.

The elevation of the Ranch is about 6500′ above sea level and the climate is normally very dry. Be sure to drink plenty of extra water to help your body acclimate to the higher elevation. Also be sure to wear sunscreen – the sun burns very easily in the high desert. While it is normally warm and dry at Ghost Ranch in June, you should bring some warm clothing. It has been quite chilly the first few days and nights of WUULF in some years, while remaining hot and dry the entire week in other years!

#### Getting Around

Workshops, housing and the dining hall are all within walking distance of one another. Be aware that the dining hall is approximately a 10-minute walk from most of the housing, and approximately 15 minutes from the camping sites.  Physically challenged individuals will be able to access the various activities and locations, however some may require effort. Notify a WUULF board member should you need extra help. Bicycles are welcome, but please remember to yield to walkers and wear a helmet.  Do not use your car any more than necessary. If you find you must drive, the speed limit is 15 miles per hour.

#### Camping

In order to minimize damage to the fragile desert ecology and to work with Ghost Ranch’s own attendees, camping will be limited to 75 people. We will assign campsites on a first come, first served basis. Full hookup sites with water, sewer and electricity are extremely limited.  Preference is given to guests with special needs.  Hot showers, ice and coin operated drink and laundry facilities are available at the campground. Campers may purchase meals for the week, which greatly simplifies your camping and scheduling challenges, while allowing you to spend more time socializing with the other WUULF (and Ghost Ranch) ““ attendees. For those not choosing the full meal plan, individual meals can be purchased directly from Ghost Ranch. Breakfast $10.00, Lunch $12.00, Dinner $14.00, Children’s meals (under 12) are 1/2 price. Finally, please note that shared site prices are for one person only. If you choose that pricing option, you will share a single tent site with another individual camper. Ghost Ranch permits a maximum of 2 tents per campsite.

#### Rooms & Cabins

The architecture of the Ranch is rustic, southwestern adobe. Most of our guests are housed in Corral Block, a hacienda style building, with family rooms, connected by an adjoining courtyard. Convenient to each room are dormitory style showers and restrooms. Please be mindful of the condition in which you leave the community restrooms for the next user. Rooms are equipped with linens and towels, but there are no phones, TVs, radios, or alarm clocks in the rooms themselves. Coin operated laundry facilities are available on campus. Meals are not included in the price of rooms and cabins. **NOTE: FAMILY RATE – Only the first two family members in the same room pay full room and board fees, additional family members pay for meals only. This special rate applies only if all family members share one room in the Corral Block and is not available in adjoining rooms.

#### Dining

Meals are served cafeteria-style in the Main Dining Hall.  Most WUULF attendees are very pleased with the food provided by Ghost Ranch.  Each meal includes a vegetarian option and fruit/salad bar.  Meals are served at specific times, so don’t be late! Campers may purchase weekly meal packages (encouraged!) on the registration form.
