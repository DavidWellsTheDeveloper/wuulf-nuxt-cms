# WUULF (Western Unitarian Universalist Life Festival)

WUULF (Western Unitarian Universalist Life Festival) is a week-long, multi-generational camp for Unitarian-Universalists from June 19th-June 25th, 2023 at the Ghost Ranch in New Mexico. We are a loving community from a diverse set of age groups, backgrounds, and cultures who gather in New Mexico each year to express our appreciation for each other and our world.

__Registration information will be available in the spring of 2023.__

#### Free from the Concerns of Your Day-To-Day

Imagine a week of being surrounded by people who are open to you and your ideas. Someone else does the cooking. You sleep in rustic motel-like accommodations, or you camp in a campground with hot showers and unlimited FREE ice (now THAT’S luxury!). There’s happy hour every afternoon. You can attend lectures, book discussions, poetry workshops. You can swim, make music, and do yoga. You can climb the dramatic Mt. Pedernal, which overlooks Ghost Ranch. You can hole up in the library, which is open 24 hours a day. You can celebrate the summer solstice in a moving ceremony held at a stunning natural amphitheater. You can hike on spectacular trails uncharted by the US Forest Service. You can take a nap whenever you feel like it. You can tour Georgia O’Keeffe’s former home in nearby Abiquiu, and you can take a whitewater (if there IS water . . .) rafting trip on a local river. If you brought children, they are off happily being supervised by a WUULF staff member every other day. If you brought a teenager, he or she might be preparing for the landmark coming of age ceremony at week’s end. You can make some new friends, or you can make friends with someone you see every week at church but somehow never find the time to talk to. And the best part about this rich and varied list of activities? Everything on it is OPTIONAL! You can do what you feel like doing, or you can do nothing at all!

#### What is a Day at WUULF like?
We begin each day with breakfast in the Ranch’s dining hall (vegan & gluten free options!  Endless coffee!), followed by an outdoor Ingathering service, led by our community minister to set our intention for the day ahead.

On **“program days”**, we are divided into Adults and Youth for different activities:  workshops, art projects, lectures, book discussions, and music.  For 2023, our Theme Speaker, Rev. Bob LaVallee, will lead us in three “Creating Theology Together” workshops.  The community rejoins for lunch, and perhaps some swimming, before afternoon activities begin.

On “non-program days” Adults and Youth are together for activities.  This can include off-site activities like river rafting and touring the Georgia O’Keeffe house, or on-site activities like tie-dying and hiking.

Each evening, following dinner, we all gather for a night of games or music or other merriment.

In between scheduled activities, there is ample time for conversation, musings, reading, and recentering yourself.

**We hope to see you at WUULF!**
